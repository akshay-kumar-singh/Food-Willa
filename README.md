# Restaurant Food Application

> **Note**: This project uses Swiggy's real API to fetch live restaurant data. As Swiggy does not officially support open API access, you might encounter **CORS issues** or **blocked requests**. To resolve these:

1. **Enable CORS**: Use the [CORS Proxy](https://corsproxy.io) with Swiggy API URLs (as done in this project).
2. **Use a VPN**: Depending on your location, Swiggy may restrict access, so a VPN might be required.
3. **API Structure**: Swiggy's API structure may change without notice, potentially affecting data fetching. Please verify the API structure or adjust paths as needed.
